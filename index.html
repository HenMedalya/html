<h2 id="link1">About Me Myself & I</h2>
<p>
<b>Hi there! I'm Hen Medalya, 35 years old, living in Rishon LeZion, Israel.</b><br><br>
<b>My motto is:</b><i>“Why fit in when you were born to STAND OUT!”</i> - Dr Seuss<br><br>
 I'm passionate about enjoying the little things in life, and I believe that this is the path to true happiness.<br>
 One of my favorite hobbies is visiting wildflower fields. I especially love sunflowers - the flowers of the sun. <br>
 The bright yellow sunflowers follow the sun throughout the day, their heads always turned towards its light. <br>
 For me, sunflowers symbolize joy and optimism - two qualities that I deeply resonate with.<br>
 I like to take pictures to remember beautiful moments from life...

<h2 id="link2">my professional experience and my ambitions for the future</h2>
<p>
I've always been fascinated by the world of computers and technology.<br>
 Over the past 7 years, I've grown into a skilled SEO (Search Engine Optimization) specialist,<br>
 This role has required me to delve into intricate details,<br>
 conduct thorough research, and consistently achieve ambitious goals. <br>
 I've also gained valuable leadership experience, spearheading and managing team to execute tasks<br>
 aligned with my carefully crafted project plans.<br>

Throughout my SEO career, I've spearheaded numerous website migrations, acquired extensive knowledge in user experience (UX),<br>
 and drafted detailed specifications for developers. <br>
Only once everything met my meticulous standards did I give the green light for site launches. <br>
My passion lies in identifying and resolving issues, which led me to pursue a career in software testing (QA).<br>
 I'm eager to leverage my skills and dedication to excel in this field.
